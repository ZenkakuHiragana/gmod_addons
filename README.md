# gmod_addons / SplatoonSWEPs!
This is a huge rework of my existing addon, [SplatoonSWEPs][1].
Commit messages are all Japanese.

The aim of this rework is the following:
* Working fine on multiplayer game (especially on dedicated servers)
* More flesh than before! (not just throwing props)
* Various options with better UI
    * Drawing crosshair
    * Left hand mode
    * Realistic scope for scoped chargers
    * DOOM-style viewmodel
    * Aim down sight
    * And so on...

# Important thing - read before you're testing
***
**I don't intend to let you enjoy the new SWEPs.  Actually I want you to test it to help me fix bugs.**  
**So, I think something like "The addon isn't working for me" isn't worth reading.**  
**If you're going to tell me you're in trouble, write at least the following:**  
* [ ] Any errors?  If so, the message in the console
* [ ] Your environment (OS, Graphics card, and so on)
* [ ] Addons in your game - Some of them may conflict. Please specify the one.  
**Something like "I have 300+ addons" isn't helpful, either.**

## Done
* A new ink system
* Inkling base system.
    You can become inkling as well.

## How to install this project
Though this is still work in progress, you can download and test it.
If you test it in multiplayer game, all players have to do as well.
* Click **Clone or download** on the top-right, then **Download ZIP**.
* Extract the zip into garrysmod/addons/.

You need the following to work it correctly.
* Team Fortress 2
* [Splatoon Full Weapons Pack][4]
* [Enhanced Inklings][5]

Playermodels are optional, but I recommend to install them, too.
* [Inkling Playermodels][6]
* [Octoling Playermodels][7]
* [Callie & Marie Playermodels][8]
* [Splatoon 2 - Octolings [PM/RAG/VOX]][9]
